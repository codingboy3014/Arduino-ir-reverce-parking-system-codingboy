Components Needed:

IR sensor
Buzzer (for alarm)
Red LED (for object detection)
Green LED (for no object detected)
Arduino Uno

Circuit:

Connect the IR sensorâ€™s VCC to 5V, GND to GND, and OUT pin to a digital input pin (e.g., pin 7).

Connect the red LED to a digital pin (e.g., pin 8) with a current-limiting resistor.

Connect the green LED to another digital pin (e.g., pin 9) with a current-limiting resistor.

Connect the buzzer to a digital pin (e.g., pin 10).
